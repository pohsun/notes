## [Creational patterns](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creational_pattern)

wiki: *Creational patterns aim to separate a system from how its objects are created, composed, and represented. They increase the system's flexibility in terms of the what, who, how, and when of object creation.*

### Factory Method Pattern
### Abstract Factory Pattern
### Builder Pattern
### Prototype Pattern
### Singleton Pattern

## [Structural patterns](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structural_pattern)

wiki: *Structural design patterns are design patterns that ease the design by identifying a simple way to realize relationships among entities.*

### Adapter
### Bridge
### Composite
### Decorator
### Facade
### Flyweight
### Proxy

## [Behavioral patterns](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behavioral_pattern)

wiki: *Behavioral design patterns are design patterns that identify common communication patterns among objects. By doing so, these patterns increase flexibility in carrying out communication.*

### Chain of Responsibility
### Command
### Interpreter
### Iterator
### Mediator
### Memento
### Observer
### State
### Strategy
### Template method
### Visitor

## [Concurrency patterns](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concurrency_pattern)

wiki: *Concurrency patterns are those types of design patterns that deal with the multi-threaded programming paradigm.*

### Active Object
### Double-checked locking
### Monitor object
### Reactor
### Thread-specific storage

## [Architectural patterns](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Architectural_pattern)

wiki: *An architectural style defines: a family of systems in terms of a pattern of structural organization; a vocabulary of components and connectors, with constraints on how they can be combined.*

### [MVC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model%E2%80%93view%E2%80%93controller)
