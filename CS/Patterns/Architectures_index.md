## Scales

The term 'architecture' could cover too much. In fact, at different view point, it 
According to [the C4 model for visualizing software architecture](https://c4model.com/), 

### Context

To describe how to achieve user's needs in terms of containers, 

### Containers

[(system design)]()

### Components
in containers [(software architecture)]() and finally

### Code

* [(design pattern)](DesignPatterns_index.md).
